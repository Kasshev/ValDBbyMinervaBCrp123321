        <h1>The HQ </h1>
        <p>Valhalla's Headquarters is located in [REDACTED] and it is concealed by the presence of a thick forrest surrounding it.
            The site is a former UNSF research base that has been abandoned years prior being found by Valhalla founders. The HQ is 
        a huge military complex that extends at least 100 meters underground. The topside part resembles a standard military
        base capable of hosting at least 80 personnel. The topside of Valhalla HQ consists of four structures: A hangar, a garage,
        a barracks building and the main building. The main building consists of multiple office buildings, an arsenal,
        a server room, a medical wing, a canteen and a room for cryogenic capsule
        </p>
        <p>The underground part of the HQ is located in a cave located directly underneath the main building and is accessible from there.
        Stuctures located under the ground can be considered to be the center of Valhalla's operation. Those structres are responsible       
        for the site's self-sustenance.
